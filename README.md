## set-up
1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. Given that this project uses Firebase, specifically Realtime Database and Firebase Authentication, you will need to create a firebase.js file. This link should help you get started on how to build that file: https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup. Make sure to export the database and authentication so you can use it in your other components.
3. Once you have written your firebase.js file, run a local development server: `npm start`.
