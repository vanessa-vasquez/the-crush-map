## set-up
1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. Since this project uses Firebase, you will need to add your Firebase credentials to a .env file. Make sure to add your .env file to your .gitignore file as well. 
3. Once you have set up Firebase with your own credentials, run a local development server: `npm start`.
